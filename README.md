# Codepen


CodePen is an online community for testing and showcasing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets, particularly front-end code. It allows developers and designers to create "pens," which are small web development projects containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be executed and displayed directly within the browser.


## Features

- Editor: CodePen provides a powerful online code editor where you can write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real-time.
- Preview: You can see the live preview of your code as you type, making it easy to visualize and debug your front-end code.
- Frameworks and Libraries: CodePen supports popular frameworks and libraries like React, Vue.js, Angular, Bootstrap, and more, allowing you to quickly prototype and experiment with these technologies.
- Sharing and Collaboration: You can share your pens publicly or privately, and collaborate with others by sharing links or inviting collaborators to work on projects together
